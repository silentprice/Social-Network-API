# Social Network API

## Description
* In this project I started with a personal project of mine and added and deleted as neccessary. Looking back it probably would have been easier starting from scratch but you learn from your  mistakes. The reaction routes gave me the most the most problems with debugging, but it was great learning experience. Insonmia is a great tool especially when your app is not deployed or can not physically see your product, which I am not a fan of, but understand why it is needed.
